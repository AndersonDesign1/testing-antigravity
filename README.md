# Neural Nexus

A premium, futuristic landing page for an AI Gaming Studio, featuring high-end aesthetics, dither effects, and interactive elements.

## 🤖 Built with Antigravity & Gemini 3

This project serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of **Antigravity** working alongside **Gemini 3**. 

- **One Mega Prompt**: The core structure, design system, and components were generated from a single, comprehensive prompt.
- **Minimal Adjustments**: The entire project required **less than 10 follow-up adjustments**, primarily focused on specific features such as:
    - Generating the Social Media (OG) Image
    - Refining Light & Dark Mode theming
    - Minor visual tweaks

It showcases how rapid and high-quality development can be achieved with advanced AI agentic coding tools.
